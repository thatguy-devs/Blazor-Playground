Just my little blazor playground solution for trying out a few different blazor and .net libraries

At them moment I'm interested in the following:

- I like what [Hassan Habib](https://github.com/hassanhabib) has done around architecture for Blazor Applications. He walks thru a great architecture for setting up views with base components, and then using those view components in your pages. Watch the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLan3SCnsISTRKj0C0ZgEG2z8aLY21tXeO).


- I've been following the work that [Weston Walker](https://github.com/westonwalker) has been doing with [Spark.NET](https://spark-framework.net/), and he has recently released [Spark.UI](ui.spark-framework.net), a collection of re-usagble Razor components, which you can copy and past straight into your Blazor application.
